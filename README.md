With this tool, you can add comments on classes and serializable fields so that they appear in the inspector.

Currently this can be done using the Tooltip attribute, but in addition, the code ends being ugly / messy, that comment is only for the inspector and there is no way to know if that field really has a comment or not

Using this plugin, you can create double-bar or XML comments and they are exported to the inspector.  
The good thing about using the XML format is that it will appear in the visual studio or monodevelop

By default, fields with comments are prefixed (i), but you can change this in the plugin settings to get the way you like
